What is ORM?
------------------------------------------
▪ Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) allows
manipulating databases using common classes
and objects

------------------------------------------
▪ Python Classes ➔ Database Tables 
------------------------------------------
Benefits of ORM
------------------------------------------
▪ Enables you to write code in your preferred OOP language

▪ Provides a layer of abstraction that hides the complexity of the
database schema and relationships

----------------------------------------
▪ Can automate some common tasks:
------------------------------------
▪ Creating, updating, and deleting records

▪ Validating data

▪ Managing transactions and connections

---------------------------------------------
Drawbacks of ORM
--------------------------------------------
▪ When it comes to complex queries and aggregations that require
high performance and flexibility

▪ Can generate inefficient or suboptimal SQL queries

▪ Poor performance

▪ Excessive memory usage

▪ Unexpected errors

▪ Limits control and customization over the SQL queries
and operations

▪ Harder to optimize

▪ May not support some advanced features or functions

--------------------------------------------------------
SQL Injection
--------------------------------------------------------
▪ SQL Injection is a type of an injection attack

▪ Makes it possible to execute malicious SQL statements

▪ Attackers can use SQL Injection vulnerabilities to bypass application
security measures so they can:
------------------------------------------------------------------------

▪ go around authentication and authorization

▪ retrieve the content of the entire database

▪ add, modify, and delete records in the database

▪ gain unauthorized access to sensitive data

▪ ORM reduces explicit SQL queries and is much less vulnerable to
SQL injection
